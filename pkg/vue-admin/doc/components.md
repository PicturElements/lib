# VueAdmin components

VueAdmin comes bundled with a number of useful UI components for use in admin dashboards. These are designed to be pluggable, versatile, and configurable. By virtue of being bundled with VueAdmin, they also fully integrate with the VueAdmin system as a whole.

### DataCell instances

DataCell is a generic class used to manage data. VueAdmin components use this class and its derivatives to efficiently facilitate the configuration and usage of data within apps. For instance, a `DataCellPagination` can be passed to a `Listing` component, and will automatically render pagination controls.
